## üìÅ Portfolio Projects

> This section highlights a few of my current and upcoming projects. Each project includes a brief description, the tools used, and key takeaways.

### üèÄ NBA 3-Point College Draft Analysis
Goal: Identify which colleges have historically produced the most successful 3-point shooters in the NBA Draft (1979‚Äì2024), focusing on volume and efficiency.
Tools: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Skills: Data cleaning, merging multiple datasets, null handling, feature engineering, EDA, visualization
Outcome: Found that a handful of programs consistently produce high-performing 3-point shooters, offering insights for scouting and performance analytics. The analysis excluded overseas, high school, and pre-1979 players to maintain NCAA-focused integrity.

### ‚ô†Ô∏è Blackjack Card Counter and Probability Advisor
Goal: Help players improve decision-making in Blackjack by calculating the probability of drawing key cards (Aces and high cards), providing card count advice, and simulating multiple-player scenarios.
Tools: Python, Colorama, Collections, Itertools
Skills: Probability calculation, card counting (Hi-Lo), user input handling, terminal-based interaction, game simulation
Outcome: Created an interactive terminal-based tool that calculates draw probabilities, performs Hi-Lo card counting, and gives real-time betting odds in multi-player/multi-deck Blackjack scenarios.

### ‚úÇÔ∏è Rock Paper Scissors Python Game
Goal: Create a fun, interactive Rock-Paper-Scissors game using Python and Pygame, complete with sound effects, hand animations, and score tracking.
Tools: Python, Pygame
Skills: GUI creation, event-driven programming, animation, sound integration
Outcome: Built a fully functional and animated Rock-Paper-Scissors game with clickable buttons, sound effects for each move and outcome, and continuous gameplay.
