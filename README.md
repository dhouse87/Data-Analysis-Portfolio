## üìÅ Portfolio Projects

> This section highlights a few of my current and upcoming projects. Each project includes a brief description, the tools used, and key takeaways.

### üèÄ NBA 3-Point College Draft Analysis
Goal: Identify which colleges have historically produced the most successful 3-point shooters in the NBA Draft (1979‚Äì2024), focusing on volume and efficiency.  
Tools: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
Skills: Data cleaning, merging multiple datasets, null handling, feature engineering, EDA, visualization  
Outcome: Found that a handful of programs consistently produce high-performing 3-point shooters, offering insights for scouting and performance analytics. The analysis excluded overseas, high school, and pre-1979 players to maintain NCAA-focused integrity.

### ‚ô†Ô∏è Blackjack Card Counter and Probability Advisor
Goal: Help players improve decision-making in Blackjack by calculating the probability of drawing key cards (Aces and high cards), providing card count advice, and simulating multiple-player scenarios.  
Tools: Python, Colorama, Collections, Itertools  
Skills: Probability calculation, card counting (Hi-Lo), user input handling, terminal-based interaction, game simulation  
Outcome: Created an interactive terminal-based tool that calculates draw probabilities, performs Hi-Lo card counting, and gives real-time betting odds in multi-player/multi-deck Blackjack scenarios.

### ‚úÇÔ∏è Rock Paper Scissors Python Game
Goal: Create a fun, interactive Rock-Paper-Scissors game using Python and Pygame, complete with sound effects, hand animations, and score tracking.  
Tools: Python, Pygame  
Skills: GUI creation, event-driven programming, animation, sound integration  
Outcome: Built a fully functional and animated Rock-Paper-Scissors game with clickable buttons, sound effects for each move and outcome, and continuous gameplay.

### üéπ MiniPiano Python
Goal: Build a virtual 32-key piano using Python and Pygame with realistic sound samples and dynamic user interaction (keyboard and mouse control).  
Tools: Python, Pygame  
Skills: Event-driven programming, sound integration, GUI layout design, interactive user input  
Outcome: Created a playable mini-piano with real-time sound feedback, volume control, light/dark themes, sustain features, and mouse support.

### ‚è≥ ReversePomodoro Python App
Goal: Flip the traditional Pomodoro technique by starting with a timed break, followed by a focused work session to boost energy and productivity.  
Tools: Python (Optional: Pygame for sound alerts)  
Skills: Timer logic, event handling, user interface display, time management app development  
Outcome: Developed a fully functional ReversePomodoro timer with adjustable break/work durations, real-time countdown, and optional sound notifications.
