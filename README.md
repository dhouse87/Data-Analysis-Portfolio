# 👋 Hi, I'm David Hovsepian

I'm a Senior Account Executive with a strong track record in enterprise software sales, account management, and partner enablement. After years of driving growth and building relationships across industries—from simulation software to cloud and analytics tools—I'm pivoting into **data analytics** to combine my strategic thinking with data-driven decision-making.

I’ve recently completed both the **Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate** and the **Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate**, building hands-on skills in SQL, Python, R, Tableau, and Excel. I'm now applying these tools in real-world projects to demonstrate my transition and passion for uncovering insights through data.
